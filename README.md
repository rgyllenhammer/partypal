Always have a pal at your party, in case you can't find anyone else.

# Idea
A text messaging app, through Twilio, that checks up on the user throughout a party. The user will be able to create an account through the app where they can list their phone number and their contacts. The user starts a session by texting the app and the app will send a message to the user every 30 minutes, until they end the session, making sure that they are ok. If the user says they need help, the app will alert all of their chosen emergency contacts immediately. In later versions, there would be two levels of friends: party friends and emergencey friends. Party friends would be contacts at the party to help the user with minor problems, emergency friends would be for when the user is in a lot of trouble. Eventually there would be a button on the app that would alert the police immediately. The app also allows for party hosts to register their party. This person would then be notified if someone felt unsafe at his/her party through the app. This shifts responsibility from those attending the party to those throwing the party to make sure people are being safe.This app is really important because of the unsafe and chaotic places that are often at parties. With this app there would always be one extra person or machine looking out for you and making sure you are safe.
