Always have a pal at your party, in case you cant find anyone else.

Party Pal is a text messaging app, through Twilio, to use when going to parties. Party Pal will check up on you throughout the night, unlike friends who might be preoccupied with their own fun. 
 
Through the app or through text, the user enters the phone numbers of the friends they want to alert that night. In later versions, there would be two levels of friends: party friends and emergency friends. Party friends to help the user get away from anyone, emergency friends for when the user is in a lot of trouble. Possibly it could alert police too.  
 
Through the app, a party head will register a party. This person would then be notified if someone felt unsafe at his/her party. This shifts responsibility from those attending the party to those throwing the party to make sure people are being safe.
This is mostly for fraternities who typically have women at their party who feel unsafe. If a frat were to use this app, it would show social responsibility and help their frat keep a positive reputation. 

To start, text [start] to the party pal number.
This initiates the program that will send a discrete message "How's the party going?"
The responses from the user can include:
[start]: starts a session for a party
it will send "Hey, how's the party going?" Every 20 minutes. 
[end]: ends a session for a party
[help]: immediately calls your number one contact for help
[man]: displays command
[alert]: sends a message to the party head, who registered through the app
