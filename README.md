# partypal
Always have a pal at your party, in case you cant find anyone else.

Party Pal is a text messaging app, through Twilio, to use when going to parties. Party Pal will check up on you throughout the night, unlike friends who might be preoccupied with their own fun. 

To start, text [start] to the party pal number.
This initiates the program that will send a discrete message "How's the party going?"
The responses from the user can include:
        [start]: starts a session for a party
                  it will send "Hey, how's the party going?" Every 20 minutes. 
        [end]: ends a session for a party
        [help]: immediately calls your number one contact for help
        [man]: displays command
        [alert]: sends a message to the party head, who registered through the app
